# Current Implementation Plan - UNIFIED API AND SCHEDULER SERVICE

## ✅ COMPLETED: UNIFIED FASTAPI AND SCHEDULER SERVICE IMPLEMENTATION

The unified service that runs both the FastAPI server and scheduler concurrently in a single process has been successfully implemented.

### ✅ What has been completed:

1. **✅ Enhanced Main Runner** (`energy_data_service/main.py`)
   - ✅ Added FastAPI server initialization alongside scheduler
   - ✅ Implemented concurrent task management for both services
   - ✅ Updated graceful shutdown to handle both services
   - ✅ Added server configuration from settings
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - ✅ Implemented unified lifecycle management

2. **✅ API Server Configuration** (`energy_data_service/app/config/settings.py`)
   - ✅ Added API server host and port configuration
   - ✅ HttpConfig includes server runtime settings (host, port, workers, access_log)
   - ✅ Environment variable support for API configuration
   - ✅ Server configuration validation on startup
   - ✅ Port range validation (1-65535)

3. **✅ Comprehensive Test Suite** (`energy_data_service/tests/app/test_main.py`)
   - ✅ Complete unit tests for API server methods
   - ✅ Tests for concurrent service startup and shutdown
   - ✅ Error handling tests for both services
   - ✅ Graceful shutdown testing
   - ✅ Configuration integration testing

4. **✅ Configuration Tests** (`energy_data_service/tests/app/config/test_settings.py`)
   - ✅ HTTP configuration validation tests
   - ✅ Port range and validation tests
   - ✅ Default value verification
   - ✅ Custom configuration testing

## Next Atomic Step: DOCKER INTEGRATION AND DEPLOYMENT

### What to implement next:

1. **Docker Configuration Update** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Expose port 8000 for API access
   - Map container port to host port
   - Update health checks to include API endpoint
   - Ensure proper network configuration

2. **Integration Testing** (`tests/integration/test_unified_service.py`)
   - Test concurrent operation of both services
   - Verify API accessibility while scheduler runs
   - Test graceful shutdown sequence
   - Validate data flow between services

### Implementation Requirements for Remaining Work:

#### Docker Configuration Features:
- **Port Mapping**: Expose 8000:8000 for API access from host
- **Health Check Update**: Add API health endpoint check alongside database check
- **Environment Variables**: Pass API configuration through docker-compose
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure both services can communicate internally
- **Volume Mounts**: Share logs directory for unified logging
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate memory and CPU limits for combined service

### Test Coverage Requirements Still Needed:

1. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_unified_service.py`) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Test both services start successfully
   - Test API endpoints work while scheduler runs
   - Test data collected by scheduler is queryable via API
   - Test graceful shutdown stops both services cleanly

2. **Docker Integration Tests** (`tests/docker/test_unified_container.py`) - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Test container starts with both services
   - Test API accessible from host machine
   - Test scheduler continues collecting data
   - Test container health checks pass

3. **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/integration/test_full_stack.py`) - **LOW PRIORITY**
   - Test complete data flow: collection → storage → API query
   - Test concurrent API requests during data collection
   - Test service recovery after errors
   - Test monitoring and logging integration

### ✅ Completed Dependencies:

- ✅ SimpleSchedulerRunner enhanced in `energy_data_service/main.py`
- ✅ Uses create_app from `energy_data_service/app/api/app.py`
- ✅ Uses Container from `energy_data_service/app/container.py`
- ✅ uvicorn integration implemented
- ✅ Integration with existing SchedulerService pattern
- ✅ Comprehensive unit test coverage

### ✅ Success Criteria Met:

- ✅ **Primary Success Metric**: Both scheduler and API server run concurrently in single process without conflicts
- ✅ **Code Quality Success Metric**: Passes all checks (ruff, mypy, pre-commit)
- ✅ **Pattern Consistency Success Metric**: Follows existing async patterns and dependency injection
- ✅ **Error Handling Success Metric**: Graceful degradation implemented with clear error messages
- ✅ **Configuration Success Metric**: Complete HTTP configuration with validation

### 🎯 Remaining Success Criteria to Achieve:

- 🔲 **API Accessibility Metric**: REST API endpoints accessible at http://localhost:8000 while data collection continues (needs Docker configuration)
- 🔲 **Performance Success Metric**: No degradation in data collection performance with API server running (needs integration testing)
- 🔲 **Stability Success Metric**: Service runs for 24+ hours without memory leaks or crashes (needs long-running tests)
- 🔲 **Deployment Success Metric**: Single docker container serves both data collection and API needs (needs Docker updates)

The unified service implementation foundation is complete. Next steps focus on Docker integration and comprehensive testing to achieve production readiness.

## Further Implementation Details

### 🔍 **Current Service Isolation Problem**

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
The current implementation has a critical gap where the scheduler service collects data but the REST API is never started, making the collected data inaccessible via HTTP:

- `main.py:338-355` starts only SchedulerService
- `app/api/app.py:34-71` contains create_app but is never called
- No uvicorn server initialization in current codebase
- Docker container runs but API endpoints are unreachable

**Current Problematic State:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Only scheduler runs, API is dormant
async def run(self) -> None:
    # ... initialization ...
    scheduler_service = await self._start_scheduler_service()
    # Wait for shutdown - API never starts!
    await self.shutdown_event.wait()
```

**Why This is a Critical Problem:**
1. **Data Inaccessibility**: Collected data trapped in database with no API access
2. **Strategy Service Blocked**: Cannot query energy data for trading algorithms
3. **Monitoring Limited**: No HTTP health checks or metrics endpoints
4. **Testing Difficult**: Cannot manually verify data collection via API

### 🛠️ **Detailed Implementation Strategy**

#### **Core Solution Approach:**
Modify the existing SimpleSchedulerRunner to manage both services as concurrent async tasks within the same event loop.

**New Unified Pattern:**
```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Both services run concurrently
async def run(self) -> None:
    # ... initialization ...

    # Start scheduler service
    scheduler_service = await self._start_scheduler_service()

    # Start API server concurrently
    api_server = await self._start_api_server()

    # Wait for shutdown signal
    await self.shutdown_event.wait()

    # Graceful shutdown of both services
    await self._shutdown_services(scheduler_service, api_server)
```

#### **Detailed Component Implementation:**

**Enhanced Main Runner Implementation:**
```python
# main.py additions
import uvicorn
from app.api.app import create_app

class SimpleSchedulerRunner:
    async def _start_api_server(self) -> uvicorn.Server:
        """Start the FastAPI server for REST API access."""
        try:
            # Create FastAPI application
            app = create_app()

            # Get configuration
            settings = self.container.config()

            # Configure uvicorn server
            config = uvicorn.Config(
                app=app,
                host="0.0.0.0",  # Listen on all interfaces for Docker
                port=settings.http.port if hasattr(settings.http, 'port') else 8000,
                log_level=settings.logging.level.lower(),
                access_log=True,
                use_colors=False,  # Better for container logs
            )

            server = uvicorn.Server(config)

            # Start server in background task
            self.api_task = asyncio.create_task(server.serve())

            self.logger.info("FastAPI server started on port %s", config.port)
            return server

        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error("Failed to start API server: %s", e)
            raise

    async def _shutdown_services(
        self,
        scheduler_service: SchedulerService,
        api_server: uvicorn.Server
    ) -> None:
        """Gracefully shutdown both services."""

        # Stop accepting new API requests
        self.logger.info("Stopping API server...")
        api_server.should_exit = True

        # Stop scheduler
        self.logger.info("Stopping scheduler service...")
        stop_result = await scheduler_service.stop()

        # Wait for API task to complete
        if hasattr(self, 'api_task'):
            await self.api_task

        self.logger.info("All services stopped successfully")
```

**API Server Configuration Updates:**
```python
# app/config/settings.py additions
class HttpConfig(BaseModel):
    """HTTP server configuration."""

    host: str = Field(
        default="0.0.0.0",
        description="Host to bind the API server to"
    )
    port: int = Field(
        default=8000,
        ge=1,
        le=65535,
        description="Port for the API server"
    )
    workers: int = Field(
        default=1,
        ge=1,
        description="Number of worker processes"
    )
    access_log: bool = Field(
        default=True,
        description="Enable access logging"
    )
```

### 🔄 **Before/After Transformation**

#### **Before (Scheduler Only):**
```python
# ❌ Current: API exists but never runs
async def run(self) -> None:
    # Database and scheduler initialization
    await self._initialize_database()
    self._validate_api_configuration()

    # Only scheduler starts
    scheduler_service = await self._start_scheduler_service()

    # Perform startup tasks
    await self._perform_startup_tasks(settings)

    # Just wait - no API access!
    self.logger.info("Press Ctrl+C to stop the service")
    await self.shutdown_event.wait()

    # Only scheduler cleanup
    stop_result = await scheduler_service.stop()
```

#### **After (Unified Service):**
```python
# ✅ New: Both services run together
async def run(self) -> None:
    # Database initialization
    await self._initialize_database()
    self._validate_api_configuration()

    # Start BOTH services
    scheduler_service = await self._start_scheduler_service()
    api_server = await self._start_api_server()

    # Perform startup tasks
    await self._perform_startup_tasks(settings)

    # Service ready with both components
    self.logger.info("=" * 60)
    self.logger.info("✅ Energy Data Service Ready")
    self.logger.info("📊 Scheduler: Collecting data every 30 minutes")
    self.logger.info("🌐 API: Available at http://localhost:8000/docs")
    self.logger.info("=" * 60)

    # Wait for shutdown
    self.logger.info("Press Ctrl+C to stop the service")
    await self.shutdown_event.wait()

    # Clean shutdown of BOTH services
    await self._shutdown_services(scheduler_service, api_server)
```

        """Test API server starts with correct configuration."""
        runner = SimpleSchedulerRunner()
        with patch('uvicorn.Server') as mock_server:
            with patch('app.api.app.create_app') as mock_create_app:

        mock_scheduler.stop.assert_called_once()
        assert mock_api_server.should_exit is True
```

#### **Integration Tests:**
```python
# tests/integration/test_unified_service.py
class TestUnifiedServiceIntegration:
    async def test_api_accessible_during_collection(self):
        """Verify API responds while scheduler collects data."""
        # Start unified service
        async with run_test_service() as service_url:
            # Trigger data collection
            await trigger_collection()

            # Make API call during collection
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(f"{service_url}/api/v1/health")
                assert response.status_code == 200

                # Query data being collected
                response = await client.get(
                    f"{service_url}/api/v1/energy-data/latest?area_code=DE"
                )
                assert response.status_code == 200

    async def test_service_recovery_after_error(self):
        """Test service continues if one component fails."""
        # Test API continues if scheduler fails
        # Test scheduler continues if API fails
```

#### **Performance Tests:**
- **Concurrent Load**: 100 simultaneous API requests during data collection
- **Memory Stability**: 24-hour run with steady memory usage (<500MB)
- **CPU Usage**: <50% CPU with both services active
- **Response Time**: API responds in <200ms during collection

### 🎯 **Migration/Rollout Strategy**

#### **Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1**: Add _start_api_server and _shutdown_services methods to main.py
2. **Phase 2**: Update run() method to start both services
3. **Phase 3**: Update docker-compose.yml with port mapping
4. **Phase 4**: Test locally with docker-compose up
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy to staging environment
6. **Phase 6**: Production deployment with monitoring

#### **Backwards Compatibility:**
- **Scheduler Logic**: Existing scheduler implementation unchanged
- **API Implementation**: API code remains the same
- **Database Schema**: No changes to models or tables
- **Configuration**: Additive changes only, existing config still works

#### **Risk Mitigation:**
- **Service Isolation**: Try/except blocks prevent one service failure from affecting the other
- **Resource Limits**: Docker memory and CPU limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **Health Monitoring**: Separate health checks for each service component
- **Rollback Plan**: Can revert to scheduler-only mode if issues arise
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test in development, then staging, then production

---

## Implementation Timeline

- **Day 1**: Implement main.py changes and test locally
- **Day 2**: Update configuration and Docker setup
- **Day 3**: Write comprehensive tests
- **Day 4**: Integration testing and bug fixes
- **Day 5**: Documentation and deployment preparation

This plan ensures the FastAPI REST API becomes accessible while maintaining the existing scheduler functionality, creating a complete, production-ready energy data service.
