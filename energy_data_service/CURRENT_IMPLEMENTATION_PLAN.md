### Implementation Requirements (Remaining):

#### Backfill Service Features:

#### Detailed Backfill Service Implementation Steps:

##### 1. Configuration Enhancement (`app/config/settings.py`) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**✅ BackfillConfig Class Implemented:**
- ✅ Historical data management: `historical_years` (default: 2, range: 1-10)
- ✅ API-friendly chunking: `chunk_months` (default: 6, range: 1-12)
- ✅ Rate limiting: `rate_limit_delay` (default: 2.0s, range: 0.5-10.0s)
- ✅ Concurrency control: `max_concurrent_areas` (default: 1, range: 1-5)
- ✅ Progress tracking: `enable_progress_persistence` (default: True)
- ✅ Resume capability: `resume_incomplete_backfills` (default: True)
- ✅ Environment variable support with `BACKFILL__*` prefix
- ✅ Full integration into main `Settings` class with proper validation

##### 2. Database Progress Tracking (`app/models/backfill_progress.py`)
**BackfillProgress Model:**
- Track backfill operations per area/endpoint/date-range
- Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
- Progress persistence for resumable operations
- Completion timestamps and statistics
- Foreign key relationships to support resumable operations

##### 3. Core Backfill Service (`app/services/backfill_service.py`)
**BackfillService Class with Key Methods:**
- `analyze_coverage()`: Identify gaps requiring backfill across all areas/endpoints
- `start_backfill()`: Begin historical collection for specific area/endpoint combinations
- `resume_backfill()`: Continue interrupted operations from database-persisted progress
- `get_backfill_status()`: Real-time progress monitoring and reporting
- `chunk_historical_period()`: Split years into 6-month API-friendly chunks
- `backfill_area_endpoint()`: Core backfill logic for single area/endpoint
- `validate_historical_data()`: Quality checks for backfilled data completeness

**API Efficiency Strategy:**
- **6-month chunks**: Balance between API limits and memory usage for 15-min resolution data
- **Sequential processing**: One area at a time to avoid rate limiting
- **Database-first approach**: Check existing coverage before making API calls
- **Intelligent retry**: Handle API failures gracefully with exponential backoff
- **Resource management**: Control concurrent operations to prevent API overwhelm

##### 4. Service Exceptions Enhancement (`app/services/service_exceptions.py`)
**Backfill-Specific Exception Hierarchy:**
- `BackfillError`: Base backfill exception with progress context and operation tracking
- `BackfillProgressError`: Progress tracking and resume failures with detailed context
- `BackfillCoverageError`: Coverage analysis issues and gap detection failures
- `BackfillResourceError`: Concurrent operation limits exceeded and resource constraints
- `BackfillDataQualityError`: Historical data validation and completeness issues
