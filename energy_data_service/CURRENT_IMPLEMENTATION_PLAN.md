### Implementation Requirements (Remaining):

#### Backfill Service Features:

- Progress persistence for resumable operations
- Completion timestamps and statistics
- Foreign key relationships to support resumable operations

##### 3. Core Backfill Service (`app/services/backfill_service.py`)
**BackfillService Class with Key Methods:**
- `analyze_coverage()`: Identify gaps requiring backfill across all areas/endpoints

### Current Status: Service Orchestration Layer Complete ✅

Both the **EntsoE Data Service** and **Backfill Service** are fully implemented, tested, and integrated. The service orchestration layer provides:

2. **Historical Data Backfill**: Comprehensive historical data collection with progress tracking
3. **Unified Configuration**: Environment-driven configuration for both services
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Complete exception hierarchy with context preservation
5. **Database Integration**: Full SQLAlchemy models with TimescaleDB optimization
6. **Dependency Injection**: Clean service composition through dependency-injector

### ⚠️ Technical Debt & Known Issues

**BackfillService Session Management (Priority: Medium)**
- **Issue**: `BackfillService._save_progress()` uses `session.merge()` as a workaround for cross-session object attachment
- **Root Cause**: BackfillProgress objects are reused across multiple database sessions, causing SQLAlchemy "already attached to session" errors
- **Current Fix**: Using `merge()` instead of `add()` for existing records - works but is inefficient
- **Proper Solution Needed**:
  1. **Repository Pattern**: Create `BackfillProgressRepository` to handle all database operations
  2. **Fresh Queries**: Always query fresh objects when updating instead of reusing instances
  3. **Session Scope**: Keep objects within the scope of a single session
  4. **Update Pattern**: Query existing object in current session, then update fields directly
- **Code Location**: `app/services/backfill_service.py:722-733` (`_save_progress` method)
- **Impact**: Minor performance overhead, architectural inconsistency with other repository patterns
- **Recommended Refactor**:
  ```python
  # Instead of: await session.merge(progress)
  # Do: Query fresh object in current session and update fields
  stmt = select(BackfillProgress).where(BackfillProgress.id == progress.id)
  db_progress = await session.execute(stmt).scalar_one_or_none()
  if db_progress:
      db_progress.status = progress.status
      db_progress.progress_percentage = progress.progress_percentage
      # ... update other fields
  ```

### Next Implementation Priority: API Layer & Task Scheduling

With the service orchestration layer complete, the next logical step is implementing the **API Layer** and **Task Scheduling** to provide external interfaces and automated operations:

**1. FastAPI Application Layer** (`app/api/`)
   - RESTful endpoints for data collection operations
   - Backfill management and progress monitoring APIs
   - Health checks and service status endpoints
   - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration

**2. Task Scheduling & Automation** (`app/scheduler/`)
   - Periodic gap-filling tasks for real-time data maintenance
   - Scheduled backfill operations for systematic historical collection
   - Health monitoring and alerting for service operations
   - Integration with task queue systems (Celery/Redis)

**3. Remaining Integration Tests**
   - Backfill service integration tests with real database and API
   - End-to-end system testing across all service layers
   - Performance testing for large-scale operations
   - Load testing for concurrent API operations

The service layer is now production-ready and provides a solid foundation for building user-facing APIs and automated data collection workflows.
