## Template Usage Notes

### Section Guidelines:

**Title Structure**: Use format "Current Implementation Plan - [LAYER/FEATURE NAME]"

**Next Atomic Step**: Should be concise but descriptive of the main goal

**What to implement next**:
- List 2-4 concrete components with file paths
- Use bullet points for key responsibilities (3-4 per component)
- Order by implementation sequence if dependencies exist

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Group by component with clear sub-headers
- Use **bold categories** for major feature groups
- Be specific about technical requirements
- Include performance, error handling, and integration requirements

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Specify test file paths following project conventions
- Cover all major functionality and edge cases
- Include performance and concurrency testing when relevant

**Dependencies**:
- List existing components this builds upon
- Specify new dependencies needed
- Note integration points with other systems
- Include future integration requirements

**Success Criteria**:
- Make criteria measurable and specific
- Include code quality, testing, performance, and integration metrics
- Always include code quality checks (ruff, mypy, pre-commit)
- End with what foundation this provides for future work

**Further Implementation Details**:
- Use this section for complex implementations that need detailed analysis
- Include problem analysis with specific code references (file:line)
- Provide before/after code examples showing the transformation
- Quantify benefits with specific metrics and percentages
- Include detailed testing strategies with code examples
- Add migration/rollout strategies for complex changes
- Use emojis to organize sections for better readability

### Best Practices:

1. **Atomic Steps**: Each plan should represent one logical implementation unit
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly state what must exist before starting
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Include both unit and integration test requirements
4. **Pattern Consistency**: Reference existing patterns to follow
5. **Future Ready**: Consider how this step enables future development
6. **Measurable Success**: Define clear, testable success criteria
